I make projects which are very random.
If you want to edit them or something feel free to as I guarantee that I will not care.
They are barely updated after a few days after release as by then I'll be doing something else.

Most of my projects are going to either be in:
 - Python
 - Javascript
 - C#

I plan to port most of my favourite projects to C# if I can.
